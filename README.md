# Case-Study-TN-Plantations-Spark

📌 **Project Overview**
This project explores Bamboo, Tea, and Rubber plantations using PySpark in Databricks. The goal is to:

1. Load and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
2. Clean data by handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.
3. Apply transformations to compute maximum production, average production, and other insights.


🛠 **Technologies Used**
  * Databricks – Cloud-based platform for big data processing.
  * PySpark – Used for data manipulation and transformations.
  * DBFS – For data storage and retrieval.
  * Pandas – Additional analysis.


📂 **Dataset Details**
The dataset contains records related to Bamboo, Tea, and Rubber plantations with attributes like:

  * Year of production
  * Region / Country
  * Crop type (Bamboo, Tea, Rubber)
  * Production quantity (tons)
  * Land area (hectares)


🚀 **Workflow**
1️⃣ Data Ingestion – Import CSV files into Databricks using PySpark.
2️⃣ Data Cleaning – Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
3️⃣ Transformations & Aggregation – Compute max production per crop, average production per region, and identify trends.


🔧 **Running the Project**
1️⃣ Upload the dataset to Databricks DBFS or Azure Storage.
2️⃣ Open the Databricks Notebook and execute the cells sequentially.
3️⃣ Modify configurations if required for different datasets.
4️⃣ Analyze the output using summary tables.


🎯 Key Takeaways
✅ Using PySpark for scalable data processing.
✅ Cleaning and transforming real-world datasets.
✅ Extracting insights with aggregations and visualizations.
